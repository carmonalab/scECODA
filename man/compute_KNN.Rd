\title{Compute K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)}
\usage{
compute_KNN(feat_mat, knn_k)
}
\arguments{
\item{feat_mat}{Numeric matrix or data frame. The feature matrix (e.g., CLR abundances).}

\item{knn_k}{Integer. The number of neighbors (\code{k}) to return.}
}
\value{
A matrix where each row corresponds to a sample and contains the indices
of its \code{k} nearest neighbors.
}
\description{
Calculates the indices of the K-nearest neighbors for each sample (row) in a
feature matrix using the \code{RANN} package.
