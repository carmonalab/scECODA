\title{Example Data for scECODA}
\format{
A named \code{list} where each element corresponds to a different study
(e.g., \code{$Adams}). Each study element is a \code{list} containing the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{cell_counts_highresolution}: Data frame of cell type counts at high resolution annotation (samples as rows, cell types as columns).
\item \code{cell_counts_lowresolution}: Data frame of cell type counts at low resolution annotation (samples as rows, cell types as columns).
\item \code{metadata}: Data frame of sample-level metadata (samples as rows).
\item \code{main_biologicalcondition_columnname}: Character string, indicating the main biological condition column name in the metadata.
}
}
\source{
Data originally derived from multiple public single-cell datasets and re-processed
as described in the accompanying scECODA manuscript (Halter et al., \emph{in preparation}).
