\title{Calculate relative frequencies (percentages) row-wise.}
\usage{
calc_freq(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or matrix of counts (samples/observations as rows,
components as columns). Must contain only numeric, non-negative values.}
}
\value{
A data frame of the same dimensions, where each row sums to 100.
}
\description{
This function takes a matrix or data frame of counts and transforms each row
(assumed to be a sample or observation) into relative frequencies,
expressing each component as a percentage of the row's total sum.
}
\examples{
counts <- data.frame(A = c(10, 50), B = c(90, 50))
calc_freq(counts)
}
