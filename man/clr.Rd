\title{Perform the Centered Log-Ratio (CLR) transformation.}
\usage{
clr(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or matrix of strictly positive relative frequencies
or counts (samples/observations as rows, components as columns).}
}
\value{
A data frame of the same dimensions containing the CLR-transformed values.
}
\description{
The CLR transformation is a common technique used for compositional data
analysis, mapping the data from the Aitchison simplex to Euclidean space.
It is defined as the log of the ratio between each component and the geometric
mean of all components in that sample. \strong{Note:} This function assumes the input
data is strictly positive (i.e., does not contain zeros). Use an imputation
or pseudocount method prior to this function if zeros are present.

\examples{
freq_imp <- data.frame(A = c(10.1, 50.1), B = c(89.9, 49.9))
clr(freq_imp)
}
