\title{Compute Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Graph}
\usage{
compute_snn_graph(feat_mat, knn_k)
}
\arguments{
\item{feat_mat}{Numeric matrix or data frame. The feature matrix (e.g., CLR abundances).}

\item{knn_k}{Integer. The number of nearest neighbors (\code{k}) used for SNN calculation.}
}
\value{
An \code{igraph} graph object where edge weights represent shared neighbors.
}
\description{
Constructs a graph where nodes are samples and edges are weighted by the number
of shared nearest neighbors (SNN) between them. This graph is used for community
detection or, in this context, modularity calculation.
