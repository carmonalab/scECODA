\title{An S4 class to represent a compositional data analysis object (ECODA).}
\description{
This class is designed to store various forms of compositional data derived
from cell counts (or similar proportional data), alongside associated
metadata, transformation results, and variability analysis outcomes.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{counts}}{Original cell count data (samples as rows, cell types as
columns).}

\item{\code{counts_imp}}{Zero imputed cell count data, typically used to handle zero
counts.}

\item{\code{freq}}{Relative frequency (percentage) of cell types derived from
\code{counts}.}

\item{\code{freq_imp}}{Relative frequency (percentage) derived from \code{counts_imp}.}

\item{\code{clr}}{Centered Log-Ratio transformed data, derived from \code{freq_imp}.}

\item{\code{celltype_variances}}{Data frame detailing the variance metrics for each
cell type.}

\item{\code{variance_explained}}{Numeric value indicating the total variance captured
by highly variable cell types (HVCs).}

\item{\code{top_n_hvcs}}{Integer specifying the number of top highly variable cell
types selected.}

\item{\code{hvcs}}{Character vector of names of the highly variable cell types.}

\item{\code{metadata}}{Data frame of sample-level metadata (samples as rows).}

\item{\code{pb}}{Data frame of pseudobulk gene expression.}

\item{\code{sample_distances}}{Data frame storing calculated distances between
samples.}
