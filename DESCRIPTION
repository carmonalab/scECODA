Description: The scECODA R package provides a complete workflow for the 
    analysis and visualization of compositional data, primarily focusing on 
    cell type proportions derived from single-cell data. It implements 
    specialized methods, such as the Centered Log-Ratio (CLR) transformation, 
    to properly analyze proportional data while avoiding the biases introduced 
    by the compositional constraint. The package encapsulates data management, 
    transformation, and analysis into a single ECODA S4 object, offering 
    downstream tools for dimensionality reduction via PCA, calculating critical
    metrics like the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Modularity to quantify 
    sample grouping quality, and generating high-quality visualizations like 
    heatmaps and scatter plots.
