#' Example Data for scECODA
#'
#' A collection of single-cell compositional data from multiple studies,
#' structured to demonstrate the full scECODA workflow.
#'
#' @format A named \code{list} where each element corresponds to a different study
#' (e.g., \code{$Adams}). Each study element is a \code{list} containing the following:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item \code{cell_counts_highresolution}: Data frame of cell type counts at high resolution annotation (samples as rows, cell types as columns).
#'    \item \code{cell_counts_lowresolution}: Data frame of cell type counts at low resolution annotation (samples as rows, cell types as columns).
#'    \item \code{metadata}: Data frame of sample-level metadata (samples as rows).
#'    \item \code{main_biologicalcondition_columnname}: Character string, indicating the main biological condition column name in the metadata.
#' }
#'
#' @source Data originally derived from multiple public single-cell datasets and re-processed
#'         as described in the accompanying scECODA manuscript (Halter et al., *in preparation*).
